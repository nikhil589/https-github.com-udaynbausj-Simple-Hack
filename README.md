# Simple-Hack
Client-Server Model using Python
I claim this as mini hack.

First and only condition is both the systems should be under same network

Steps to Run:

Step1 : run server.py

Step2 : run client.py

Then, Hack begins, as server.py system gets control of client.py system.

Enjoy...........

Future Works : To send large files(1GB) over network using FTP.
